            help either before or after any injury or damage may occur.

            By signing the “Sign-in Sheet”, I, for myself and for my heirs, next of kin assigns, and personal representatives, hereby agree to and do release, indemnify

            Gym, and their officers, employees, and agents, and/or volunteer assistants, from any and all injuries and damage which I, or the person upon whose
            behalf I am signing in, may sustain or incur arising out of or related to my use of the SDSU Wellness Center Climbing Gym, its facilities, grounds, climbing
            walls, exercise areas, equipment, participation in classes or events, and/or outdoor programs guided by or connected with the SDSU Wellness Center
            Climbing Gym, whether the use is supervised or unsupervised. I, for myself and for my heirs, next of kin, assigns, personal representatives, and persons
            upon whose behalf I am signing the “Sign-in Sheet,” hereby agree to and release, indemnify and hold harmless the State of South Dakota, South Dakota
            Board of Regents, South Dakota State University, and the SDSU Wellness Center Climbing Gym, and their agents, employees, offices, and, volunteer

            RELEASED PERSON(S) OR ENTITY(IES) HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY THROUGH THEIR COLLECTIVE OR
            INDIVIDUAL NEGLIGENCE.

            I and/or person on whose behalf I am signing-in, voluntarily assume complete responsibility for risks and any injuries or damage which may occur as a result of
            those risks even if the manner or type of injury or damage occurs in a manner that is not foreseeable at the time this Waiver Agreement is accepted. In
            consideration of my use of the gym, its equipment, employees, volunteer assistants, independent contractors, I agree to and do release, indemnify and hold
            harmless, the SDSU Wellness Center Climbing Gym, and any and all of their agents, servants and employees, from all liability, claims, demands and damages
            and further promise not to commence any action or proceeding asserting same.
